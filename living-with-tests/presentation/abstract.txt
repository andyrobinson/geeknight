how's this?

an intermediate level look at automated testing aimed at those
regularly using automated test code.

the talk aims to share understanding of some of the largest, most
common issues around automated test ownership as the presenter sees
it.

segments will include: the test automation pyramid, why and when of
builders and the dangers of static data, using stubs to automate
testing against external systems, use of page objects for browser
website testing, what your tests are telling you about your design.

the majority of the talk will be looking at code, mainly in Java.
there will be some higher-level diagrams and conceptual chat about
testing cost and value.
